# Testing WebSocket Reconnection System (Deprecated)

## Overview

This ad-hoc manual test guide has been deprecated. The application now uses a centralized Socket.IO service with internal reconnection and health monitoring. Automated scripts used during development are not included in production.

## Running Tests

Not applicable in production builds.

## Test Scenarios

Removed.

## Test Results

### Sample Output

Deprecated.

## Troubleshooting

Use the in-app Connection Health panel for current status. For runtime issues, rely on application logs and health events rather than external scripts.

## Customizing Tests

Not applicable. Runtime configuration is managed via environment variables and app settings; no test config is needed.

## Integration with Development

Not applicable.

## Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks are observed in-app via health checks rather than external scripts.

## What's New

Call History now shows the proper called or missed call number.

### Dialed Number Shows in Appbar
The ringing number and ring status will now show in the Appbar.
### Automatic Updates
After downloading V.5.0.0, No more manual downloads! The app now checks for updates automatically and lets you install them with one click. You'll see a notification when a new version is available.

### Improved Consent Form
- The consent checkbox now shows a clear green checkmark when accepted
- The form is locked until you check the consent box - this ensures proper documentation
- A helpful message appears reminding you to accept consent before proceeding

### Date Filter for Client Records
You can now filter client cards by date range. Select a start date, end date, or both to quickly find records from specific time periods.

### Privacy Protection
The "Reason" field on client cards is now blurred by default to protect sensitive information. Simply hover over it to view the content.

### Better Confirmation Dialogs  
All confirmation prompts (delete, logout, clear history) now use clean, styled popup dialogs instead of the basic browser popups.

## Bug Fixes

### Reports Now Include Same-Day Records
**What was happening:** When you created a new client record and ran a report for that day, the new record wouldn't appear in the report.

**What was fixed:** Reports now correctly include all records up to the end of the selected date, so same-day records will always appear.

### Data Consistency
Nationality and Region fields now only accept values from the dropdown options, preventing any data entry inconsistencies. We have to clean up the database to remove any invalid entries. The best way is to extract 
the current data, archive it then delete the old database and create a new one.

# Advanced Call Handling

This guide covers advanced call handling techniques for MHU Helpline agents, including managing multiple calls, transfers, conferences, and special call scenarios.

## Call States and Their Meaning

Understanding call states helps you manage calls effectively:

- **Ringing**: An incoming call that hasn't been answered yet
- **Connected**: An active call where you're speaking with the caller
- **On Hold**: The caller has been placed on hold and cannot hear you
- **Muted**: You've muted your microphone (caller cannot hear you, but you can hear them)
- **Transferring**: A call in the process of being transferred
- **Conferencing**: Multiple parties in a single call
- **Wrapping Up**: Call has ended, but you're completing documentation

## Managing Inbound Calls

### Call Screening

When receiving an inbound call:

1. Review any available caller information before answering
2. Answer with the appropriate greeting: "Thank you for calling MHU Helpline, my name is [your name]. How may I help you today?"
3. Verify the caller's identity if they're a returning client
4. Determine the nature of the call and its priority

### Queue Callbacks

If a caller has requested a callback from the queue:

1. Review the callback information, including the original wait time
2. Call the client back using the softphone's outbound call feature
3. Reference that you're returning their call: "Hello, this is [your name] from MHU Helpline returning your call from earlier today"
4. Document the callback attempt, even if unsuccessful

## Call Transfers

### Warm Transfer (Attended Transfer)

A warm transfer allows you to speak with the destination agent before transferring the call:

1. Inform the caller that you'll be transferring them
2. Click the "Transfer" button in the softphone
3. Select or enter the destination (agent, queue, or external number)
4. Wait for the destination to answer
5. Brief the destination agent about the caller's situation
6. Complete the transfer by clicking "Complete Transfer"

### Cold Transfer (Blind Transfer)

A cold transfer sends the call directly to the destination without prior consultation:

1. Inform the caller that you'll be transferring them
2. Click the "Transfer" button in the softphone
3. Select or enter the destination
4. Click "Blind Transfer" to immediately transfer the call

### Transfer to Queue

To transfer a call to a specific queue:

1. Click the "Transfer" button
2. Select "Queues" from the transfer options
3. Choose the appropriate queue from the list
4. Optionally add transfer notes that will be visible to the receiving agent
5. Complete the transfer

## Conference Calls

### Setting Up a Conference Call

To create a conference call with multiple participants:

1. While on an active call, click the "Conference" button
2. Select or dial the number of the third party
3. Once the third party answers, click "Join Conference"
4. All parties will now be connected in a conference call

### Managing Conference Participants

During a conference call, you can:

- Mute individual participants
- Remove participants from the conference
- Add additional participants (up to the system limit)
- End the conference for all participants

## Handling Difficult Call Scenarios

### Escalation Procedures

When a call needs to be escalated:

1. Inform the caller that you'll be involving a supervisor
2. Use the "Request Supervisor" button or place the call on hold briefly
3. Contact your supervisor through the chat system or direct line
4. Either transfer the call to the supervisor or add them to a conference call

### Managing Distressed Callers

When dealing with callers in distress:

1. Remain calm and speak in a soothing, measured tone
2. Use active listening techniques and validate their feelings
3. Follow the crisis intervention protocols established by MHU
4. Know when to engage emergency services if the situation requires it
5. Document the call thoroughly, including any risk assessments performed

### Call Disconnections

If a call disconnects unexpectedly:

1. Attempt to call the client back immediately
2. If reconnected, apologize for the disconnection
3. If unable to reconnect, document the attempt and the point at which the call was disconnected
4. If the call was with a client in crisis, follow the disconnection protocols for at-risk clients

## Using Call Recording Features

### Recording Calls

Calls are automatically recorded according to system settings, but you should:

1. Be aware of which calls are being recorded
2. Inform callers that calls may be recorded for quality and training purposes
3. Know how to pause recording for sensitive information if your role permits this

### Accessing Call Recordings

To access previous call recordings:

1. Navigate to the "Call History" section in your agent portal
2. Find the call you wish to review
3. Click the "Play Recording" button to listen to the call
4. Use the playback controls to pause, rewind, or fast-forward as needed

## Call Disposition and Wrap-Up

### Proper Call Disposition

After each call:

1. Select the appropriate disposition code that best describes the outcome
2. Add any necessary notes about the call
3. Complete any required forms or documentation
4. Set follow-up tasks or appointments if needed

### Wrap-Up Time Management

To efficiently manage wrap-up time:

1. Complete essential documentation while the call is fresh in your mind
2. Use templates and quick-text features for common responses
3. Set a personal time limit for wrap-up (typically 1-3 minutes per call)
4. If you need extended wrap-up time, use the appropriate status code

## Performance Metrics

Understanding how your call handling is measured:

- **Average Handle Time (AHT)**: Total time spent on calls and wrap-up
- **First Call Resolution (FCR)**: Percentage of issues resolved without callbacks
- **Transfer Rate**: Percentage of calls transferred to other agents
- **Quality Score**: Rating based on call evaluations
- **Client Satisfaction**: Feedback from post-call surveys

## Best Practices

### Professional Communication

- Use a clear, professional tone throughout all calls
- Avoid jargon and explain technical terms when necessary
- Practice active listening by paraphrasing and confirming understanding
- Use positive language even when delivering difficult information

### Call Efficiency

- Use the knowledge base to quickly access information
- Learn keyboard shortcuts for common softphone functions
- Keep frequently used resources readily accessible
- Document calls concurrently when possible to reduce wrap-up time

### Self-Care Between Calls

- Take deep breaths between difficult calls
- Use brief stretching exercises during wrap-up time
- Stay hydrated throughout your shift
- Utilize your scheduled breaks fully
